# PC LOAD LETTER Demonstrations

This project holds a collection of sub-projects that go along
with my PC LOAD LETTER development classes.

## Projects

- [db](./db) contains a Dockerfile, scripts, and seed data
for a database for other projects' use.
- [db-interaction](./db-interaction) has code to load additional
data into the datbase and demonstrations of key things to keep
in mind when working with a database.
- [web-stream](./web-stream) demonstrates streaming a large
result set over an HTTP response.
